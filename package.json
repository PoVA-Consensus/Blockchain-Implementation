Ensure that Ganache is running \tI am using a Ganache GUI server. It runs as soon as I open the GUI. Also confirm that the port number is 7545. 4. Build the Contract \trun `truffle migrate`. It should compile and deploy the contract. A build folder will be generated and populated. If theres any issue with compilation, run `truffle compile` and debug from there. If theres any issue with deployment, verify that the ganache instance is running. 5. Run the server \tRun `node server.js` and check if it connects to the ganache instance. This is where it is currently failing",
